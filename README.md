# trashgame
a trashy trash game being pieced together by someone who's never made a game in their life. warioware style microgames. maybe a narrative structure. maybe pure bedlam. it's all up in the air-- *i'm learning this shit as i goooooo*

# the stack
built on vanilla [processing 3.1](https://processing.org "processing website").
there's a contributed library for animated gfx in there somewhere and due credits are present but i think i'm going to roll my own in the future, so don't hold your breath for a credits header
